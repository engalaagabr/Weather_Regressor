# Weather Data Regression Project

This project applies machine learning regression models to the **Weather History dataset** for predicting weather variables. It demonstrates a full pipeline from preprocessing to model evaluation.

##  Approach

* **Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and generating polynomial terms.
* **Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.
* **Evaluation**: RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* **Visualization**: Data distributions, correlations, and model residuals.

##  Findings

* Linear Regression served as a baseline.
* Decision Tree captured non-linear patterns but risked overfitting.
* Random Forest delivered the most reliable performance.
